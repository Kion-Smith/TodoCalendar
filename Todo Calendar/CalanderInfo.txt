
My file syntax(or markup lang) called .ksc stands for Kion Smith Calendar format

[year/month/date]: { "some data"; "some other data";}

my own file format is quicker than xml and more readable than json,and if I want to implment use with some online calander adding events should be easy




////////////////////////
//idea for json
{
	"month":"some month"
	
	monthData:{
		"date": some number value
		dateData:{}
		//then the list array
	}

}

//xml

<?xml version ="1.0">

<Cal>
	<Year>
		<Date>
			<List Information> </List Information>
			<List Information> </List Information>
		</Date>	
	</Year>
</Cal>

I like xml more
	- its readable
	- its simple to make

I Like json because
	- it doesnt need to check for as much (i.e quicker)
	- easier to debug
